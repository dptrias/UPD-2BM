# UPD-TBM

This repository contains the code and scripts developed for the Bachelor's Thesis in Aerospace Engineering at the **Technical University of Madrid (UPM)**.

## Overview

The objective of the thesis was to analyse how different possible equilibrium configurations of **underplatform dampers (UPDs)** affect the vibrational response of **bladed-disks** during operation.

A simplified model composed of **two blades and one UPD**—accounting for a total of **5 degrees of freedom (DOFs)**—was implemented for this purpose.

## Contents

The scripts and source code in this repository were the primary tools used for the analysis and simulation carried out in the thesis.
